# i-am-the-weather
An app that grab user location, saves it to a database, and allows users to check in at various locations. 

Inspired by: 1) One of my favorite authors, Jonathan Safran Foer, and his latest book "We Are The Weather", 
2) Daniel Shiffman and his amazing Coding Train tutorials. 

This application let you check in at various locations and outputs different location and associated air quality information on
a map rendered by Leaflet.js
